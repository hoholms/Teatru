# Teatru
CEITI Practice Java task. The program representing the work of the theatre.

The Theater program implements the work of the theatre. Every year, various performances are staged and held in the theater, some even abroad, at tournaments. Each show has a certain budget (a certain amount of money is allocated). Actors are hired for different roles on the show. An agreement is concluded with each actor, which provides for remuneration for the show. Each actor has a certain stage of work (expressed in years). Some of them have certain titles (Honored Artist, People's Artist, etc.), and are laureates of various awards. In one performance, several actors can play the same role. The contract determines the main remuneration, but, according to the results of the performances played de facto, the actor may receive a fee, depending on the country where the show took place. There are also inactive employees in the theater (manager, director, cashier, set designers or props, make-up artists, etc.). For each employee in the program, the following information will be indicated: first name, last name, personal identification number (IDNP), home address, nr. phones, functions, etc. The software product should allow calculating the cost of each performance played, the remuneration of actors for different periods.
